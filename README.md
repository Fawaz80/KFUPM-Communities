# KFUPM-Communities
Dear dev,
Please note the following when you start working:
1. It is recommended to use bootstrap in order to simplify the process, and have cleaner and nicer elements.
2. Refer to the figma file whenever you are lost, and approximate the distances and sizes as you see fit.
3. If something is not clear, contact me via WhatsApp.
4. When you start working make sure you are working on your part only, as some elements are shared through many pages but only need to be created once (such is the navbar).
5. We will be working to finish the desktop website front end, as for the mobile website it is to be done later.

These are all the notes for now.
